# What is "Xian Yu"?

"Xian Yu" is pronunciation of "咸鱼" (Chinese word) which means "Salted Fish" in English.  
It's an interesting and famoues culture in Chinese internet, it begin because Stephen Chow say "If people do not have the goal, then what is the difference with the salted fish (人要是没有了目标, 那跟咸鱼有什么区别)" in his movie.  
We also love this culture to joking ourself are all "Salted Fish" which means do not have the goal.  
So we named our World Editor as "Xian Yu World Editor(XYWE)".
